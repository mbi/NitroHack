DynaHack x.y.z (xxxx-yy-zz, 0000000)
====================================

This section describes the current development version of DynaHack which has not
yet been officially released; scroll down for information about officially
released versions.

Highlights
----------
* New body armor and shield skills: grants bonus AC and MC; heavier suits of
  armor and shields get bigger bonuses and train the skills faster.
* Magic chests!  Any item put into a magic chest can be looted out of any other
  magic chest in the dungeon, placed at set locations.  This eliminates tedious
  stash consolidation and transporting of items to and from stashes and fixed
  dungeon resources like altars, shops and water.
* Mazes completely removed from Gehennom!
* New resistance system: resistances gained from corpses and crowning only
  provide partial protection.
* Reflection no longer reflects breaths (except disintegration).
* Instant petrification completely replaced with delayed petrification: you will
  always have a few turns to save yourself from instant death.
* Drawbridge instant death removed: drawbridges can only be destroyed by force
  bolts when closed, not open.
* Extra turn before drowning attack instant death.  Players upgrading from an
  older version of DynaHack should adjust their `msgtype` as described in the
  Configuration section of this changelog.
* Zombie corpses may revive (lower chance if playing a priest).
* Sokoban prizes moved to Mines End, making Sokoban much more optional.
* Nymph level moved into Town branch; Town shops are larger to compensate.
* Effect of skills on to-hit and damage raised in general.
* Items that spawn with a magical property have a much higher chance to spawn
  with additional properties.
* Slings now get damage bonuses from strength and enchantment.
* Spells can be aborted at direction, position and item prompts without using
  power or hunger.
* New `repeat_prefix` keymap and `repeat_num_auto` option for people accustomed
  to NetHack's classic number key movement scheme.
* New `msg_per_line` option: Shows each message on a new line in the message
  area when enabled.
* Potion color alchemy improved in favor of players, making it more of an
  alternative to NetHack's alchemy instead of a nerf.
* Curses on armor, jewelry and eyewear are now revealed when they are worn
  instead of when trying to take them off.
* More messages for things that used to happen silently: uncontrolled
  teleportation, finding secret doors/corridors while searching, items becoming
  randomly cursed.
* Iron bars can be destroyed by acid or eaten by certain monsters.

Character
---------
* Resistances gained from corpses and crowning only provide partial protection,
  and resistances from your race/role or from worn equipment are immunities
  (based on L's partial resistance patch).  Exact partial resistance effects:
    - fire, cold, shock: half damage
    - sleep: half duration, doubled chance to awaken from combat
    - disintegration: 90% chance to resist
    - poison: half damage, having any protects against other effects
    - As a side effect of this patch, negative AC and half physical damage
      resistance no longer reduce damage from fire, cold, shock or acid attacks.
* Reflection no longer reflects breaths; disintegration breath is treated as a
  beam to prevent unfair deaths due to this change.  The breath graphic has been
  changed accordingly.
* Changes to skills:
    - New body armor skill:
        - Body armor skill grants bonus AC and MC for suits of body armor based
          on their weight and capped by your skill, as well as weight reduction
          for worn body armor.
        - Grants (weight / 50 - 2) bonus AC for body armor capped at +2 at
          basic, +4 at skilled and +7 at expert.
        - Grants (weight / 100 - 1) minimum MC for body armor capped at MC1 at
          basic, MC2 at skilled and MC3 at expert.
        - Reduces weight of worn body armor heavier than leather armor (150wt)
          according to the difference: 25% at basic, 50% at skilled and 75% at
          expert, e.g. plate mail (450wt) only weighs 225wt at expert skill.
          This reduced weight does not affect the AC or MC bonuses above.
        - Trains to expert in between 16k and 24k turns; wearing heavier suits
          of body armor speeds up training.
        - Maximum skill levels:
            - Expert: Knight, Samurai
            - Skilled: Barbarian, Convict, Priest, Ranger, Valkyrie
            - Basic: Archeologist, Caveman, Rogue, Tourist
            - Restricted: Healer, Monk, Wizard
            - Unlike weapon skills, body armor skill always starts at unskilled.
    - New shield skill:
        - Shield skill grants bonus AC and MC for shields based on their weight
          and base AC, and is capped by your skill.
        - Grants (weight / 20 + base AC) bonus AC for shields capped at +2 at
          basic, +4 at skilled and +7 at expert.
        - Grants (base AC + [1 if weight > 50]) minimum MC for shields capped at
          MC1 at basic, MC2 at skilled and MC3 at expert.
        - Trains to expert in between 11.2k and 16.8k turns; wearing heavier
          shields speeds up training.
        - Maximum skill levels:
            - Expert: Knight, Priest, Valkyrie
            - Skilled: Archeologist, Barbarian, Ranger, Rogue, Samurai
            - Basic: Caveman, Convict, Tourist
            - Restricted: Healer, Monk, Wizard
            - Unlike weapon skills, shield skill always starts at unskilled.
    - Martial arts and bare-handed combat now get to-hit bonuses from skills
      just like weapons do (from SporkHack).
    - Allow 1-damage hits to still train relevant skills; in NetHack, hitting
      with a weapon at unskilled gives -2 to damage, so weapons that couldn't
      roll at least a 4 on damage wouldn't be trained at all!
    - Accelerate heavyshot skill training: hitting with a heavyshot weapon
      trains the relevant skill by 1dX points similar to its damage multiplier.
    - Training of spellcasting skills restored to NetHack values: 20/80/180 for
      basic/skilled/expert (was 100/200/400).
    - Effect of skills on to-hit and damage raised in general (from dNetHack):
        - Expert weapon skill gives +5/+3 to-hit/damage (was +3/+2).
        - Expert two-weapon skill gives -2/+2 to-hit/damage (was -3/+1).
        - Skilled riding gives +2 to damage (was +1).
        - Expert riding gives +2/+5 to-hit/damage (was +0/+2).
        - Restricted weapon skill gives -5 to damage (was -2).
    - Feeling more confident in your skills now interrupts multi-turn actions.
    - Unskilled no longer causes thrown/fired projectiles to slip due to low
      skill level; this is now limited to restricted skill.
    - Allow monks to reach expert skill in shuriken.
* Increased sling damage: slings now get the strength damage bonus (otherwise
  reserved for melee) and sling enchantment affects damage of fired projectiles
  (normally launcher enchantment only affects to-hit); their damage now even
  competes with thrown daggers!
* Change effect of luck on to-hit to +(Luck / 3) across the board (previously
  it was +Luck to everything except melee; from SporkHack).
* Spells can be aborted at direction, position and item prompts without using
  power or hunger.
* Teleport control allows teleportation to be cancelled without using a turn and
  in the case of deliberate teleports consuming hunger.
* Punishment (i.e. being attached to a ball and chain) no longer stops you from
  displacing pets.
* Movement at low HP (less than 10, or 5 if polymorphed) is stopped at strained
  (the same encumbrance that causes HP loss on movement) instead of stressed,
  which simplifies the relationship between encumbrance, HP loss and stopped
  movement a bit:
    - Before:
        - Stressed
            - cannot move with less than 10 HP (5 if polymorphed)
        - Strained
            - lose 1 HP every 30 turns if moving
            - lose 1 HP every 3 turns if attacking
    - After:
        - Strained
            - cannot move with less than 10 HP (5 if polymorphed)
            - lose 1 HP every 30 turns if moving
            - lose 1 HP every 3 turns if attacking
* Rogues start with a +1 short sword (was +0).
* Samurai start with a +3 wakizashi (was +0), which slightly out-damages their
  starting +0 katana.
* Player vampires no longer try to drink blood when biting or abuse dexterity
  while satiated (from UnNetHack).
* Player vampires may bite petrifying, sliming or disintegrating monsters if
  stunned, confused or hallucinating (from UnNetHackPlus).
    - Players polymorphed into mind flayers will stop themselves from biting
      petrifying, sliming and disintegrating monsters, as long as they are not
      stunned, confused or hallucinating (from UnNetHackPlus).
* Prevent player vampires from trying and consequently failing to bite shades.
* Show message when trying and failing to engulf a huge monster while
  polymorphed as an engulfing monster (from UnNetHackPlus via UnNetHack).
* Fix C343-238: "(Unix and VMS only) The 'Who are you?' prompt does not accept
  digits in the response."  The official bug description is inaccurate: it's
  names that START with a digit that aren't accepted by vault guards, and it
  applies to all platforms.
* Fix ring of sustain ability blocking -1 strength change when becoming weak
  from hunger, allowing it to be exploited to gain strength on demand.
* Fix off-hand weapon properties remaining after ending two-weapon combat.

Dungeon
-------
* New dungeon feature: magic chests!
    - Any item placed in a magic chest can be looted out of any other magic
      chest in the dungeon, removing the need to consolidate stashes.
    - Magic chests are placed in set locations near useful resources such as
      altars, shops and water, reducing the distance that items need to be
      hauled to such resources.  The set locations are:
        - Minetown
        - Sokoban entry level
        - Fort Ludios
        - Quest home level
        - Castle
        - Valley of the Dead
        - Orcus-town
        - Fake Wizard's Tower
    - Magic chests are fixed to the ground and as such cannot be tipped.
    - Attempting to put a corpse set to revive into a magic chest will revive it
      immediately, to prevent exploiting them to get rid of such corpses.
* New trap type: shuriken traps, which only appear in quest levels of certain
  roles.  Replaces dart traps in monk and samurai quests, and also sometimes
  for ranger and rogue quests.
* Changes to quest levels:
    - Add guaranteed tinning kit to the Valkyrie quest home level to give
      players an alternative to eating giant corpses whole for strength and
      waiting out the satiation outside of the quest portal.
    - Remove squeeze gap in Caveman quest home level.
    - Redesign Ranger quest home level with a more organic layout and wider
      corridors (from dNetHack, originally by Khor).
        - Redesign Ranger quest goal level with water, trees and an altar
          (dNetHack).
* Changes to standard rooms-and-corridors level generation:
    - Grid room level style (from K-Mod).
    - Raise chance of special rooms-and-corridors level style from 10% to 20%.
* Changes to Medusa's Island:
    - Give the shortsighted flag to new Medusa's Island levels from UnNetHack,
      to reduce swarming from ravens/snakes turning those levels into glorified
      Big Rooms with more water.
    - The shield of reflection in the statue of Perseus now has the same chance
      of being blessed or cursed as any other item, instead of being cursed or
      uncursed with the probability based on the map encountered.
* Changes to Gehennom:
    - Mazes completely removed from Gehennom!  Both fill levels and filler
      around special levels consist of lava caverns.
    - Add demon lairs for Geryon, Dispater, and Yeenoghu (from GruntHack).
* Changes to the Town branch:
    - Nymph level is now guaranteed and appears between the Town surface and
      filler levels.
        - Nymph level no longer contains traps (squeaky board or otherwise).
        - 90% of spawns on the Nymph level are nymphs and leprechauns.
    - Town surface level has larger shops.
* Changes to Vlad's Tower:
    - New entrance level to Vlad's Tower with trees, water, vampires, zombies,
      ravens and a drawbridge entrance leading to the traditional tower levels
      (from dNetHack).
* Changes to the End Game:
    - Moving on the Plane of Air is generally much easier, as it now only stops
      movement when failing a d20 roll against your dexterity (was previously
      75% of the time for all characters).
* Sokoban prizes moved to Mines End; the end of Sokoban now has a guaranteed
  sack containing 8 rings and wands (the ring and wand on each level has been
  removed as a result).  This makes Sokoban much more optional in DynaHack than
  it is in NetHack.
* Remove lava from one of the versions of the Castle level.
* Levels between Medusa's Island and the Castle are now water caverns instead of
  lava caverns, and have less evil monsters.
* Allow magic mapping of the Valley of the Dead and the last Dragon Caves level.
* Iron bars can be dissolved by acid (from UnNetHack).
* Destroying iron bars in Sokoban counts against its shortcut conduct.
* Drawbridge instant death removed: drawbridges can only be destroyed by force
  bolts when closed, not open.
* Prevent magic traps from being created above dungeon level 5.
* Reduce initial scuffing of randomly-placed engravings to increase the chance
  that they can be read when they're first encountered.
* Fix the cosmetic issue of horizontally-flipped levels appearing slightly
  misaligned in the map area.
* Fix waking monsters level-wide when entering courts, swamps, morgues, zoos and
  nymph gardens for the first time without stealth; only monsters in the room
  being entered have a chance to to be woken.
* Fix tracking of upward branches with `#history`, and make a note when entering
  any new level and not just deeper ones (from NetHack4).

Wishing
-------
* Wands of wishing are generated with at least one charge (1-3 instead of 0-2,
  from UnNetHack 5).
* Players can wish for up to (and including) 100 projectiles (from
  UnNetHackPlus via UnNetHack).
* New alternate spellings recognized by the wish parser:
    - "wolfsbane" (sprig of wolfsbane)
    - "scroll of teleport" (scroll of teleportation)

Items
-----
* New item: silver short sword (SLASH'EM), d6 damage (d8 vs. large), weight 36.
* Potion color alchemy improved in favor of players, making it more of an
  alternative to NetHack's alchemy instead of a nerf:
    - All color-based random potion descriptions are now guaranteed to map to an
      in-game potion.  Previously, with 25 random potions and 37 descriptions
      for them, some colors would fall into the gap, making it impossible to use
      them in alchemy and cutting out useful mixtures.
    - Potions of full healing, gain level and gain ability are guaranteed to map
      to secondary colors (i.e. puce, magenta, orange, amber, emerald, dark
      green) or the browns (i.e. ochre, brown), so they will always be the
      outcome of some alchemy combinations.
* More formal identification for items under certain circumstances:
    - Formal ID tin whistles and magic whistles when used.
    - Formal ID magic flutes and magic harps when used.
    - Formal ID enchant armor scrolls when they turn dragon scales into dragon
      scale mail.
    - Formal ID rings of stealth and elven cloaks when wearing or taking them
      off gives or takes away stealth, to make them consistent with elven boots.
* Changes to the Amulet of Yendor:
    - Amulet of Yendor need only be carried to give hints about nearby magic
      portals, instead of having to wield or wear it (from SporkHack).
    - Amulet of Yendor has a much higher chance of giving hints about nearby
      magic portals, and may map/detect them if carried in inventory.
    - Amulet of Yendor no longer teleports when dropped.
* Guarantee a wand of cancellation in the Castle chest that can be used for
  blanking scrolls and potions.
* The shield of reflection now weighs 50 (was 75) due to the introduction of the
  new shield skill.
* Wielding or unwielding a weapon of stealth identifies the stealth property on
  that weapon and gives identifying messages similar to wearing other items that
  grant stealth.
* Hitting a monster with a weapon of stealth identifies the stealth property on
  that weapon.
* Improve stacking of random candles by removing random chance of them being
  blessed or cursed (from AceHack).  Between wax and tallow candles, and
  blessed, uncursed and cursed status, an inventory could be filled with 6
  different candle stacks, even with DynaHack's improved item stacking!
* Grant +1 to-hit for all short swords (from K-Mod).
* Allow knife and stiletto as possible tin-opening tools (from K-Mod).
* Items that spawn with a magical property have a much higher chance to spawn
  with additional properties.
* The "magical" prefix on items is only omitted once all properties on it have
  been identified instead of once any of them have been, making it easier to
  discover items that have more than one property.
* Show which hand a ring of levitation was on when a sink forcefully removes it.
* Rings with enchantment +3 or lower no longer have a chance to explode when
  charged, and rings at -5 or lower will only explode from cursed charging (from
  SporkHack).
    - Remove ring destruction from shock damage.
* Quest artifacts that are spawned at the final level of the Quest will be
  generated fixed/erodeproofed.
* Having free action reduces paralysis from using a crystal ball from 1-10
  turns down to 1-2.
* Land mines and beartraps weigh less (200/100 respectively, previously
  300/200; from UnNetHackPlus via UnNetHack).
* Changes to shuriken:
    - Shuriken no longer break when thrown at monsters.
    - Shuriken now weigh 3 (previously 1) and cost 10 zorkmids (previously 5).
* Crossbow bolts only break half as often as other projectiles when fired at
  and hitting monsters.
* Fire, cold and shock immunity prevent item destruction.
    - Wearing a cloak of protection prevents 80% of all item destruction.
* Fix prefixes like "magical" and "prize" not appearing on rings, wands,
  spellbooks and iron balls under certain circumstances.
* Fix C343-146: "Unseen wand of striking becomes known if zapped by unseen
  monster and it hits a door."
* Fix wielding of a cockatrice corpse bare-handed while wearing chromatic dragon
  scales or scale mail not triggering petrification.
* Fix leaking of descriptions of prizes selected from level memory with far-look
  after the prize itself has vanished.
* Fix contents of containers created on special levels not being included in the
  initial container weight.
* Fix completely eroded armor being destroyed by further erosion when greased or
  erodeproofed.
* Fix crash when item is unequipped or lost while being equipped (from
  NetHack4).
    - Fix ring worn message being shown after it is forcefully removed by a sink
      when wearing a ring of levitation over a sink.

Monsters
--------
* Instant petrification completely replaced with delayed petrification: you will
  always have a few turns to save yourself from instant death.
* Drowning attacks give two turns for players to react before instant death (was
  one turn); a monster "pulls you towards the water" before it drowns you.
* Zombie corpses may revive (lower chance if playing a priest).
* All eels in water can now be seen from afar, like other monsters.
* Metallivores and disintegrators can eat through iron bars (from UnNetHack).
* Allow Demogorgon to be bribed.
* Tone back demon bribery amounts inherited from UnNetHack: demons now only ask
  for 1000 to 2000 gold.
    - Giving within 80% of the money demanded for a demon bribe succeeds between
      25% to 75% of the time depending on how close your offer is to the
      demanded amount.
* Tone back 1-to-1 initial monster population difficulty inherited from
  NetHack4: it is now only like that for the first 10 levels, then 1-to-2 for
  the remainder.  This gives a progression similar to that of NetHack.
* Tone back on the effect of a monster's level on its raw spell damage;
  otherwise Asmodeus cold spell-casting attack could do over twice the damage of
  Master Kaen without cold resistance, which is too much even for overprepared
  characters.
* Gnomes that spawn with candles will only get a single candle instead of a
  whole stack of candles.
* Pets never displace the player from the stairs when entering a level.
* Ninja have a 50% chance to spawn with some shuriken.
* Remove distintegrators.
* Nymphs always generate asleep (was 80%).
* Fix monsters getting your racial armor bonuses instead of theirs.

Interface
---------
* More messages for things that used to happen silently:
    - Show message when teleported without teleport control.
    - Show message when searching finds secret doors or corridors.
    - Show messages for and reveal BUC of items that are randomly cursed by e.g.
      the Wizard of Yendor or sitting on a throne with bad luck.
    - Show a message of the identity of whistles and instruments when they are
      discovered on use.
    - Show message when pets or other monsters grow up (from SLASH'EM Extended).
    - Attacking with a weapon of stealth, as well as with a knife while
      stealthy, gives a message that you "silently hit" or "silently kill"
      monsters, hinting at options for fighting without awakening nearby
      monsters.  These messages are new, but the mechanic itself is not.
* Make wearing and taking off messages more descriptive, e.g. "You finish taking
  off a +0 leather armor" instead of "You finish taking off your suit."
* Curses on armor, jewelry and eyewear are now revealed when they are worn
  instead of when trying to take them off.
* Skill training progress is now visible in the `#enhance` menu, e.g. "long
  sword [basic] 20%" means the long sword skill is 20% of the way to advancing
  to skilled.
    - Mark skills that have reached their maximum as "MAX", and show it as soon
      as the level is reached.
    - Suppress "0%" in `#enhance` menu for untrained skills.
    - Show skill caps in `#enhance` menu, e.g. "long sword [basic / expert]".
    - Show skill slot cost to enhance skills when choosing a skill from the
      `#enhance` menu, e.g. "Enhance knife to Basic for 1 slot (2 slots left)?
      [yn] (n)"
* Show your character's race, role, gender and alignment when asked to enter a
  name for that character (based on the same change in NetHack4).
* Highlight lit light sources in item listings, e.g. inventory sidebar.
* Adjust `safe_water` and `safe_lava` behavior: they only warn of walking into
  such hazards in your INPUTTED direction, but won't stop you if stunning or
  confusion causes you to stumble sideways into them.
* Show the tombstone on death even if skipping disclosure information.
    - Extend the tombstone by a line for longer death causes, e.g. "petrified by
      kicking a chickatrice corpse".
* Allow aborting of position prompts for jumping, polearm pounding, grappling
  hooks, scrolls of stinking cloud (still consumes the scroll), paying with
  multiple shopkeepers in sight and spells of fireball and cone of cold.
* Dungeon `#overview` can toggle showing levels with no notable features.
    - Dungeon `#overview` no longer exits after viewing a single level.
* Make extended command prompt case insensitive, like NetHack's (from NetHack4).
* Change default corridor character back to `#` in Unicode graphics mode.
* Show warning level 0 for very weak monsters when the player has a source of
  warning (previously these monsters were not shown at all).
* Pressing escape at "--More--" now shows the last messages in the message area
  instead of simply cutting them off.
* Improve numpad key recognition for default PuTTY configuration where
  application keypad mode is enabled by default.
* Fix the color of the Wizard's Tower walls when viewed from another level using
  the `Ctrl-O` dungeon overview.
* Fix "T - take off" not appearing in the item action menu of meat rings.
* Fix coordinates reported when getting a position from the player.
* Fix Rogue level graphics leaking onto other levels when Unicode graphics
  option is set but Unicode support is not detected.
* Fix ugly borders in PuTTY by replacing ncurses box drawing characters with
  Unicode box drawing characters.

Configuration
-------------
* New `repeat_prefix` in the `keymap` option: Custom key to begin entering
  repeat prefixes for commands, e.g. set to "n" so "n20s" searches for 20 turns.
* New `repeat_num_auto` option: toggle whether or not pressing a number key
  automatically begins entering repeat prefixes; people who have a habit of
  using the top-row number keys for diagonal movement can toggle this option off
  and map those keys to the movement commands under the `keymap` option.
* New `msg_per_line` option: Shows each message on a new line in the message
  area when enabled; can improve readability of messages when the message area
  is large.
* "* pulls you towards the water!" mapped to MORE action under `msgtype` submenu
  option for the message given in the new extra turn before monster drowning
  attacks.
* Frames and borders now respect the 'graphics' option, using Unicode box
  drawing characters in Unicode mode, and ASCII replacements in plain mode.

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Scramble some words in messages on April Fools Day (from NAO).
* Fix end-of-game scores for non-ascending games being doubled like ascending
  ones.

Technical
---------
* xlogfile patch (via NetHack 4).
* Allow certain directories to be customized on game launch:
    - `-H <dir>` to set the data dir (e.g. nhdat, license)
    - `-V <dir>` to set the var data "playground" dir (e.g. xlogfile, bones)
    - `-U <dir>` to set the user dir (e.g. player saves and config files)
* Set file permissions on *nix-like operating systems (e.g. Linux and OS X) to
  644 for player config files, preserved save log files, dumplogs, `logfile`,
  `xlogfile` and `record`.
* Rename launch script for *nix-like operating systems (e.g. Linux and OS X)
  from `dynahack` to `dynahack.sh` to prevent it from overwriting the actual
  game or confusing and being ignored by the installation system in case the
  build system is accidentally set with identical `SHELLDIR` and `BINDIR` paths.
* Replace `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in `dynahack.sh` *nix-like launch script with an
  rpath configured on the `dynahack` binary.
* Allow `INSTALL_BASE` to be passed to the initial cmake invocation to quickly
  set `BINDIR`, `LIBDIR`, `DATADIR` and `SHELLDIR` to sensible default paths
  under it.
* Clean up timer debugging code a bit.
* Limit name of character to `PL_NSIZ` bytes.
* Clear and redraw the screen every 100 turns to stop dgamelaunch from
  replaying the entire session when trying to spectate a game.
* Improvements to static builds (i.e. build configured with `ALL_STATIC`
  enabled):
    - `-fPIC` no longer included with static builds.
    - `libnitrohack.a` no longer installed with static builds, since it's
      already rolled into the game binary.
* Treat improperly-truncated save files like crashed ones, instead of trying
  and failing to load/restore them.
* Verify integrity of timers and light sources attached to monsters and objects
  to prevent unloadable save files.
    - Fix timers being transferred into timer chains out-of-order (NetHack 4).
* Fix warning when leaving bones while wielding an attached heavy iron ball.
* Fix infinite loop when placing a branch entrance on joined cavern levels.
* Allow SPILL lev_comp command to accept 0 as a size for e.g. breaking holes in
  cavern walls.
* Fix some replay desyncs due to uninitialized data.
* Prevent random chance to same-race polymorph in wizard mode.
* lev_comp: New `prize` flag for `OBJECT` statements, denoting objects that
  should be considered a prize of that level; prizes are ignored by monsters,
  don't fall down holes, are ignored by autopickup, and picking up a prize
  causes other prizes on that level to vanish.

  sidebar is updated while saving bones.

DynaHack 0.5.5 (2014-01-16, 78d772a)
====================================

DynaHack 0.5.5 was a bugfix release for a potential crash with items contained
in statues interacting with the timer-related fixes in the previous releases.

Technical
---------
* Prevent a crash when the timer-related fixes of the past couple of releases
  touched items contained in statues due to the latter's failure to correctly
  set their level.

DynaHack 0.5.4 (2014-01-06, 34706ac)
====================================

DynaHack 0.5.4 was a hotfix release for a timer-related issue.

Technical
---------
* Fix lights and timers failing to follow the items they were attached to when
  the items were moved between levels, causing affected games to fail to load.

DynaHack 0.5.3 (2013-12-24, 32216b3)
====================================

DynaHack 0.5.3 was a bugfix release that fixed a panic when loading a game with
timed items in the Advent Calendar as well as a few other bugs, and adds the
new `darkmsg` option to control whether past messages are darkened.

Character
---------
* Fix warning when trying to take off merged dragon skin.

Dungeon
-------
* Prevent the Advent Calendar exit portal from being created in one of its
  closets (from UnNetHack).

Items
-----
* Various `#tip` fixes from the same feature in UnNetHack:
    - Tipping a trapped container triggers the trap.
    - Fix tipping of a zero-charge bag of tricks being used as a normal bag.
    - Prevent autopickup from picking up tipped items.
    - Observe cat when tipping boxes dropped by quantum mechanics.

Configuration
-------------
* `darkmsg` option: toggle whether or not older messages are colored dark blue
  in the message box.

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Fix blank lines being eaten when viewing license and version history in-game.

Technical
---------
* Fix billing of items in nested containers and crediting of contained gold in
  the deep recesses of the shop code that could lead those things suddenly and
  silently becoming shopkeeper property, even if they didn't typically sell
  them!
* Fix utilities updating but failing to rebuild the data files that depended on
  them; stale data files like the ones packaged with DynaHack 0.5.0 should be a
  thing of the past.
* Fix crash when positioning a revived monster on entering a level.
* Fix panic due to timers failing to find the Advent Calendar level during
  loading (the last level of the ledger in general), preventing affected games
  from being loaded.

DynaHack 0.5.2 (2013-10-07, 5f067e7)
====================================

DynaHack 0.5.2 was a hotfix release that greatly increased save file integrity
and ability to recover save files by fixing cases of incomplete data being
logged that were overlooked by NitroHack and NetHack4.

Saves
-----
* Fix systemic oversight in save code ported from NetHack4 that failed to
  ensure that diffs of the binary save section were being fully written to the
  log, leading to save corruption.
* Fix `autopickup_rules` and `msgtype` failing to ensure that changes to them
  were being fully written to the log, leading to save corruption.

DynaHack 0.5.1 (2013-09-28, a1289c3)
====================================

DynaHack 0.5.1 was a hotfix release to fix a packaging mistake with the Windows
release that caused special levels to fail to load.

Configuration
-------------
* Disable `darkroom` by default when `darkgray` is also off by default, since it
  led to ugly dark blue for almost everything not in direct line-of-sight.

Technical
---------
* Fix a major packaging mistake with the pre-compiled Windows build where
  certain special level data files had a version number incompatible with the
  shipped game executable and thus refusing to load them and show a generic
  full-level maze instead.

DynaHack 0.5.0 (2013-09-18, 65751e0)
====================================

DynaHack 0.5.0 is the first public release of DynaHack.  It was originally
intended to be a port of UnNetHack using NitroHack instead of NetHack 3.4.3 as
a base (in fact it was originally named "UnNitroHack", though no version with
that name was ever officially released), but has since taken on a life of its
own with interface and reliability improvements from NetHack4, highlights from
other NetHack variants such as random magical equipment from GruntHack and
monster spoiler info from UnNetHackPlus, plus many of its own changes.

UnNetHack itself is a NetHack variant that features more randomness, challenges,
levels and fun, rolling in many community patches, selected changes from other
NetHack forks like SporkHack and SLASH'EM, and many original changes.

Interactive replays
-------------------
* Saved and finished games can be replayed with a viewer built into the game
  client.  Commands like view inventory can be performed while viewing a replay.

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Improve died-while-helpless descriptions.
* Fixed about 10% of all known NetHack bugs.

Technical
---------
* NitroHack network protocol: Supports network play without telnet or ssh.  The
  protocol is based on JSON and makes it easier to implement a browser-based
  NitroHack client (TODO!).
    - The game is divided into a client and server: the client has a copy of
      the game for independent local play but can also connect to a server for
      online play.
* New save game format: NetHack's save format was mostly just a dump of binary
  structures to disk.  The new format has two sections:
    1. A log of the initial random seed and every game action performed, written
       continuously as the game is played.
    2. If the game is not being played, a binary save appended after the log.
       This section uses a fixed-width, fixed-endian architecture and
       compiler-independent format which resembles NetHack's format but can be
       loaded on any system the game will run on.
* Full separation of interface code from game code.
    - The game core has been moved into a library
      (libnitrohack.so/nitrohack.dll), exposing an API of 23 functions and is
      largely OS independent.
    - The display code is part of the OS/platform and must provide a list of
      callbacks (windowprocs) to the game.
    - The core game and display code have no shared global state.
* Rewritten input system: The game core never requests raw keys from the
  interface.  All interactions happen on an abstract level: the interface sends
  commands to the game core as strings ("wait", "move", etc.), and the game core
  may ask for a direction or position, etc.
* Layered drawing: The game core provides a set of display items for each
  location instead of just setting the topmost like NetHack.  The Curses
  interface blinks between them; this can be toggled with an option.
* Mersenne Twister random number generator: Required to make game logs
  replayable.
* Re-runnable game core: Several main data structures have been made const, all
  others are carefully re-initialized when a game is started or restored.
    - This makes it possible to provide the main menu.
    - NitroHack now uses a setjmp/longjmp exception mechanism to escape from
      deep call-chains when the game ends or panics.
* Temporary level files and lock files removed.
    - All levels are now kept in memory at all times, making a lot of locking
      unnecessary, and allowing them to be viewed even from other levels.
    - Only active game logs are locked, and even then only using OS-provided
      non-file-based locking (fcntl on UNIX and LockFile on Windows).
* No more support for antique systems and compilers.
    - Dropped operating systems: BE, DOS, Classic Mac, Atari, VMS, Ultrix, etc.
    - Supported compilers has been reduced to gcc, clang and msvc (probably
      Intel's compiler too).
    - Doing this allowed the removal of lots of crufty code and compat macros,
      e.g. all current compilers support `void` and `static` so wrapping them in
      defines is no longer needed.
* Code cleanups.
    - Number of `#ifdef FOO` has been cut down from 1938 to just 51, making the
      code much more readable since indentation isn't being interrupted every
      couple of lines.  Compile options that weren't turned into birth options
      were removed as a result.  Functions have been converted to use standard
      prototypes rather than pre-C89 K&R declarations.  Ugly things like
      prototype widening and follow-on `FOO_P` defines were removed too.
      Thanks to these changes, tools like `git diff` can now correctly show
      what function a line is in.
    - All instances of the `register` keyword have been removed since optimizing
      compilers handle this for us.
    - NEARDATA has been removed since it only made sense on 16-bit computers.
* New CMake-based build system.
    - This removes the need to manually edit Makefiles and header files just to
      build the game.
    - Provides safe parallel builds with colorized output on Linux, and
      generates Visual Studio project files that build without problems on
      Windows.
